My name is Chenhui Shen (申琛惠). I'm a PhD candidate of [HPC-AI](https://ai.comp.nus.edu.sg/) under the supervision of [Prof. Yang You](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~youy/) at National University of Singapore (NUS). I also studied Electrical Engineering (Honors) in NUS as an undergraduate student. 
I am also an intern at [Alibaba Cloud Singapore (DAMO Academy)](https://damo.alibaba.com/?language=en) under the Industrial PhD Program (IPP), who generiously support my research. Please check my [CV](/cv.pdf) for further information. 


Research
------
My current research mainly focus on Natural Language Processing, specifically Natural Language Generation and Summarization.
