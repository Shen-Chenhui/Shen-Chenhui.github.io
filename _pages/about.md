Iâ€™m a MEng student in Nanyang Technological University (NTU), supervised by [Prof Chng Eng Siong](https://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/aseschng/default.html/) & [Prof Sun Aixin](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/axsun/). Before joining NTU, I was a research intern in National University of Singapore, supervised by [Prof Wang Ye](https://smcnus.comp.nus.edu.sg/). Please check my [CV](/cv.pdf) for further information.

**I will apply for Ph.D. starting from Fall 2021. Feel free to drop me an email if interested!**

Research
======
My current research mainly focus on Natural Language Processing, especially Dialogue Relation Extraction. In addition, I'm highly interested in many other related areas like Machine Learning, Knowledge Graph, Information Retrieval , Computer Vision, Speech, and High Performance Computing. I am always happy to chat with others about interesting research ideas, and looking for academic collaborations. Please drop me an email if you are interested in collaborating with me.  

Specifically I am interested in the following research topics:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Relation Extraction, Dialogue System and Knowledge Graph.**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Bayesian Deep Learning and Graph Neural Network.**   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Speech Recognition and Speaker Recognition.**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**High Performance Computing and Distributed System**
