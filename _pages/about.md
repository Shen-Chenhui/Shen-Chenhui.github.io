My name is Fuzhao Xue. You can also call me Frio if you prefer. I'm an MEng student in Nanyang Technological University (NTU) with an outstanding academic performance (5.0/5.0), supervised by [Prof Chng Eng Siong](https://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/aseschng/default.html/) & [Prof Sun Aixin](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/axsun/). Before joining NTU, I was a research intern in National University of Singapore, supervised by [Prof Wang Ye](https://smcnus.comp.nus.edu.sg/). I will start my Ph.D. degree in [HPC-AI](https://ai.comp.nus.edu.sg/) under the supervision of Prof. [You Yang](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~youy/) at National University of Singapore (NUS). Please check my [CV](/cv.pdf) for further information.

Research
======
My current research mainly focus on Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning and High Performance Computing. One recent interest is designing algorithm and system to train large and efficient language models. In addition, I'm highly interested in many other related areas like Knowledge Graph and Speech. I am always happy to chat with others about interesting research ideas, and looking for academic collaborations. Please drop me an email if you are interested in collaborating with me.  

Specifically I am interested in the following research topics:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**NLP: Language Modeling and Relation Extraction.**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**ML: Conditional Computation, Bayesian Deep Learning and Graph Neural Network.**   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**HPC: Distributed Machine Learning.**
