My name is Fuzhao Xue. I understand this name is a bit hard to pronounce in English. It sounds like Full-Draw Xue. Please also feel free to call me Frio if you prefer. I'm a PhD candidate of [HPC-AI](https://ai.comp.nus.edu.sg/) under the supervision of Prof. [You Yang](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~youy/) at National University of Singapore (NUS). I received my MEng degree from Nanyang Technological University (NTU) with an outstanding academic performance (5.0/5.0) in 2021, supervised by [Prof Chng Eng Siong](https://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/aseschng/default.html/) & [Prof Sun Aixin](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/axsun/). 

I also worked as a student researcher at [Google Brain](https://research.google/teams/brain/), with [Yi Tay](https://vanzytay.github.io/) and [Mostafa Dehghani](https://mostafadehghani.com/). Please check my [CV](/cv.pdf) for further information.


Research
======
My current research mainly focus on Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, and High Performance Computing. One recent interest is designing algorithm and system to train efficient large language model and other foundation models (e.g. vision, embodied agent). I am always happy to chat about interesting research ideas, and looking for academic collaborations. Please drop me an email if you are interested in collaborating with me.

Personal information
------
Personal Hobbies: basketball, fitness and cooking. I also enjoy watching movies and listening to music, although, unfortunately, I'm a terrible singer. Fortunately, I think I have a gift for cooking. Maybe you can say Fuzhao (Frio) is zero-shot cooking learner. :)
Another interesting thing is: I have the chance to be Newton's eighteenth generation of students. The acadamic family tree is [here](/AcademicFamilyTree.pdf). Looking forward to the day!
